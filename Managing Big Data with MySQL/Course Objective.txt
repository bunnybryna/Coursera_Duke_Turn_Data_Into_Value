Week 2: In Week 2 your aims should be to become comfortable with the Teradata front end interface, and the small differences in MySQL and Teradata SQL syntax. You should also aim to get a good sense of what information the Dillard’s data set contains, and what kind of analysis questions the data set could help you answer. Finish the week knowing how to retrieve, and change the format of data from single tables that meet specified criteria.

Week 3: In Week 3 your aims should be to become very confident in your ability to use the main keywords in a SQL query, and to begin appreciating how long queries take when you are combining data from multiple tables with millions of rows. Finish the week knowing how to summarize data, how to segment summaries of your data, and how to combine data across multiple tables.

Weeks 4/5: In Weeks 4 and 5, your aims should be to become comfortable translating analysis questions into SQL queries, and confident that you can generate creative approaches to retrieving data in formats that are different from the way they are stored in a database. You should also aim to gain a deeper appreciation of how long real queries take to write and to execute. Overall, you want to finish these weeks feeling like a completely independent SQL analyst!
